# Writing tests

Vitest and React Testing Library are set up by default.

To write your tests, add a `file-name.test.ts(x)` file next to the source file you'd like to test, and write your tests within.

To run your tests, run `npm run test`. This will use `--watch` mode, so that any changes you make to your test files will be immediately picked up by Vitest (causing your test to be re-run).
